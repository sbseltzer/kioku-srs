# Intro
In general, all popular/modern OS platforms are to be targeted. Ideally all compilers released within the past 5 years are supported as well.

The support noted here refers to whether the Kioku library, and by extension the default server implementation, can be built/tested on the target configuration.

At this time there are no automated tests for the server implementation, but that is planned for the future as the REST API becomes more stable. There is also no browser compatibility matrix for the default client implementation at this time.
